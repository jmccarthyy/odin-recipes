    <h1> Air-Fried Cajun Spiced Salmon</h1>
    <img src="./meals/salmon.jpeg" alt="Salmon">
    <h2>Serves 2</h2>
    <p>
        This air fryer salmon is full of flavor with a hint of sweetness. It's moist, delicious, and ready in under 10 minutes. If using an unsalted Cajun seasoning, you may want to season the fillets with salt before serving. I like to use a Misto sprayer with oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray. For best results, use 1-inch-thick, center-cut fillets.
