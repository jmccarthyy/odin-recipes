    <h1>Steak Mince Smashburgers</h1>
    <img src="./meals/burger.jpg" alt="Burger">
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.
       Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold.
       I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!
